# A *Swift* Survey of X-ray Clusters

This is for all the files we used to write the paper associated with the *Swift* Survey of X-ray Clusters.

## Notebook overview

#### Catalog Stuff
1. `01. Results Catalog` Make the initial results catalog. Basically collects the results from the analysis in the main directory
2. `02. Inspect Multi-source Fields` Look at fields with more than one extended source detected. Identify which is the "main" source
3. `03. Blank Fields` Make a catalog of all the fiels where no extended sources were detected
4. `04. Inspect Blank Fields` Inspect the black fields for issues. Basically we double check they are actually blank
5. `05. Flag Known Issues` Update the results catalog with known issues. See text for what that means

#### Paper Figures
1. `F01. RASS Rates` Figure 1. Target selection based on RASS rates.
2. `F02. Sky Coverage` Figure 2. Where the clusters are on the sky.
3. `F03. Exposure Distribution` Figure 3. Distribution of XRT exposure times.
4. `F04. Radial Profiles and Classification` Figure 4. Example of extended/point source classification
5. `F05. Lum Ratios and F06. Lum Fit` Figure 5 and 6. Figures for the data validation section
6. `F07. Lx vs Redshift` Figure 7. Main result figure! X-ray luminosity as a function of redshift.
7. `F08. Lx vs Redshift - blank` Figure 8. X-ray luminosity upper limits for the blank fields. 

#### Paper Tables
1. `T01. Deep Fields` Table 1. Deep fields excluded from the work.
2. `T02. Results Table` Table 2. Example of final results catalog.
